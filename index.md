## Chrome Experiment
### by **Philip Rideout**

This demonstrates high-performance 2D graphics using **giza**, a little WebGL library that I'm
developing.  Click the refresh icon in the header to generate a new random tree structure.  Hold shift while clicking to repeat every 2 seconds.

If you shrink the window, the canvas maintains its aspect ratio using a responsive pattern called **Basic Fluid Image**, described [here](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html).

If you're wondering why it's called **monarchy**, it's because I had planned for this to be a visualizer for the British royal family, from William the Conqueror to Elizabeth II.  Other projects lured me away before I got very far.
